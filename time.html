                    <p>What are the days of the week? The days of the week are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Watch the video to learn about the days of the week.</p>
                </h2>
                <p>The English language has retained the planet names for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. However, the names for the other days of the week have been replaced by their equivalent Norse or Germanic gods. Some Asiatic languages such as Hindi,
                    Japanese, and Korean have a similar relationship between the weekdays and the planets.</p>
                <p>There are many different opinions as to how the 7-day week originated. The most common explanation points to Babylonian astrologers who assigned planet gods to the days of the week around 700 BCE.</p>
                <p>The Romans later replaced these names with their planet gods in the ancient Roman calendar and Germanic and Norse people later did the same with some of their gods.</p>

                The 12-hour-system in English In English there is no 24-hour-system (sometimes it is used on TV and in timetables). 15:00 is 3 o'clock (p.m.) (on TV: fifteenhundred). That's why you use a.m. (Latin: ante meridiem) and p.m. (post meridiem) in situations
                where it is necessary to point out that you want to say in the morning or in the evening. In other situations (or when it is clear that school starts in the morning and the party in the evening) it is left out.</h2>
                <p>When to use o'clock o'clock (abbreviation: of the clock) only on the hour.</p>

                <p>Many students might be used to a 24-hour clock in their native culture. To begin telling time, it's a good idea to just go through the hours and make students aware of the fact that we use a twelve-hour clock in English. Write the numbers
                    1 - 24 on the board and the equivalent time in English, i.e. 1 - 12, 1 - 12. It is also best to leave out. 'a.m.' and 'p.m.' at this point.</p>

                <p> Climates are the result of the unequal heating and cooling of the Earth. Circulation of the atmosphere moves a lot of thermal energy around the globe. Circulation of water in the ocean (ocean currents) can also influence regional climates.
